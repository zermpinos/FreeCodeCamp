# FreeCodeCamp
Here I will post my attempts to solve the projects in the FreeCodeCamp curriculums.
DISCLAIMER: I am uploading my solutions to the projects of FreeCodeCamp for academic purposes only. 
As FreeCodeCamp strongly prohibits plagiarism and copying of solutions, I do not grant permission for anyone to use my code for any purpose other than personal learning and reference. 
Any use of my code that violates the FreeCodeCamp academic honesty policy is strictly prohibited.
